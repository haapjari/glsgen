# Greetings

Hello! I am Jari Haapasaari ([mail](mailto:haapjari@gmail.com)), and I originally developed the initial version of this project as a part of my thesis, later decided to some extent rewrite the project, and included this in my very first article. This was originally my first project written in `Go`.

Feel free to copy parts of the code, fork the project, or use it as a reference. I am happy to receive feedback, and I am open to collaboration!
